              <h3>Volunteer Lines Project - Overview</h3>
              <p>This project was carried out as my final year project at Northumbria University.
                  The project aim was to design and develop an event planning and managment platform that allowed
                    prospective event planners to hire volunteers to assist at thier events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rightOverviewVolunteerLines">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a simple concept that aimed to reduce the cost for
              event managers that wanted to host a professional event as this website aimed to provide
              a professional service without the cost. This was becasue people would plan thier own events
              and control eventything. The build consisted of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP. </p>
