        <div class="overview">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>This project was carried out as my final year project at University.
                 The project aim was to design and develop an event planning and management platform
                 that allowed prospective event planners to create and manage their own event without
                 the help of an event planner. Some functionality includes hiring volunteers to
                 help at events they are interested in. This would work in the form of requests
                 where the admin user can send a request to a volunteer and vice versa.
                 This was a simple concept that aimed to reduce the cost for event
                 managers that wanted to host a professional event as this website
                 aimed to provide a professional service without a high admin cost.
                 This was because people would plan their own events and control everything.
                 The build consisted of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP.
               </p>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteerLinesApproach">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
             <p>The project took a structured approach to help achieve its aims with the whole project
               lasting around 9 months. An agile methodology was used to help the project transition
               through the stages at a managed pace. The steps taken included some initial user research,
                sketches, user journey flow diagrams, wireframes, prototyping and user testing.
                A more detailed explanation of these steps can be found in the following writing below.</p>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p class="explanation-text">
                The design process ran using an iteration cycle that can be seen depicted in the corresponding
                diagram. This was important for the project to ensure that each stage had the same amount of
                time spent on them really focusing on how each design could work for the end user.
               </p>

               <p class="explanation-text">
                 This cycle is continuous in motion as the project has completed one cycle it should go
                 around again to focus on any other problems that may have arisen during user testing.
                 Doing this should always improve a user journey as more is learnt about who the users are,
                 their needs and end goals.

            The finished prototype was tested with 5 real users who could potentially
            use the site if it went live. The process involved giving each user a
            questionnaire to complete. This focussed on gathering some initial details
            about them which could be used as part of the results later. This was
             optional with users able to omit if they wished.

       <p class="user-testing-text">
          After this the user was faced with a series of tasks in which they would start on a
          specific page and navigate around the prototype on their own until the tasks
          are completed. At the end of the test users were presented with another
          questionnaire to gather some more information about how they found the overall
           experience which again could be used when iterating.
       </p>

       <p class="user-testing-text">
            The tests were all done in the same conditions with a screen recording being done
            capturing what each user was doing on screen. After all the user testing
            had been completed a detailed analysis took place looking at the video
             footage of user’s actions along with the questionnaire feedback.
             The success was recorded on the metric of users doing a task
             correctly with failure being when a task is not completed properly.

            The end analysis was written up in a report which detailed the success,
             failures, interesting points and trends of users. This feedback is very
