        <div class="overview">
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>This project was carried out as my final year project at Northumbria University.
                The project aim was to design and develop an event planning and management platform
                that allowed prospective event planners to hire volunteers to assist at their events.
                This was a simple concept that aimed to reduce the cost for event managers that
                wanted to host a professional event as this website aimed to provide a professional
                service without the cost. This was because people would plan their own events and
                control everything. The build consisted of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP.</p>

      <div class="volunteerLinesApproach">
      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>The project consisted of many different stages that helped to complete the finished product.
            The stages consisted of some initial user research that was done in the form of a litriture
              review. Some of the research looked at potential competitors, ways of working and producing
                design documents.</p>

                <p>Once the design documents had been constructed the development phase began. The development
                      was constructed based upon the content of the design documents to ensure consistency
                        is being kept with the considerations of the other research being in mind. Finally, the
                        product was tested using a blackbox testing technique. The product was also user tested with
                          real users. The results of this were written up as the analysis which also took into
                          consideration the project as a whole.</p>
